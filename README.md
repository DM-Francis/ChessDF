# ChessDF

My attempt at creating a mediocre chess engine in C#.  Uses a basic Alpha-Beta search algorithm and a very basic evaluation that looks at standard piece scores.  Otherwise it makes random moves.  Implements the Universal Chess Interface (to some extent), so can be used with standard chess interfaces.

Heavily inspired by the amazingly generous resources on https://www.chessprogramming.org.

Lofty goals are
* Get beaten by my own chess engine.
* Implement some kind of machine learning integation in the style of AlphaZero/Leela Chess Zero.
